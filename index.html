                <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
                    California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew
                    Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial
                    success
                    as an unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular acts
                    (The
                    Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed
                    even
                    further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.
                </p>

                <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
                    ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s
                    original
                    and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts
                    of
                    this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid
                    and
                    authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, The Bees Knees are
                    currently
                    recording their second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
